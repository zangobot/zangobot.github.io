# Hello, nice to e-meet you! 

My name is Luca Demetrio, I'm currently *post-doctoral researcher* at the [University of Cagliari](https://pralab.diee.unica.it/). 

I took my Ph.D., master and bachelor degrees in Computer Science in 2021, 2017 and 2015 at the [university of Genova](https://dibris.unige.it), and here you can find my [curriculum vitae](assets/CV.pdf).

I am also a [tap dancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance) with 10+ years of experience.
