This post includes the very first game I have created from scratch in my entire life.
First year at the university, the summer before I was only just an high school student (we are speaking of the 2013... ).

I began mixing the things I love playing and the first notion of programming I was trying to learn by myself.

The result is named **Run, Chocobo, run!**, and it is my very first attempt of moving sprites on a screen.
It is a runner game where you control a tiny little [Chocobo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocobo) in its infinite journey.
The chocobo has to avoid contact with the mosters it faces during its long run: by pressing the space bar, the chocobo will jump.
As the game progresses, the speed of out cute hero increses, so the player needs to react faster.
Each change in speed is followed by a change in the background.
There is also a scoreboard in the main men√π, where you can play a little bit with the tiny Chocobo.

That's the end of the game!

I coded it in C#, using the Windows Forms framework.
Pretty ancient, isn't it? ;-)
