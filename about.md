My name is [Luca Demetrio](https://csec.it/people/luca_demetrio), and I am a PhD student at [DIBRIS - University of Genova](https://www.dibris.unige.it/).
There many things that captures my interests, from science to art.

One of these amazing stuffs is *adversarial machine learning*, or as I prefer, *the noble art of abusing AI programs*.
I'm currently studying evasion attacks against malware detectors, and I'm having so much fun :3

In my second life, I'm an *amateur dancer*, and my love for dancing is comparable to the enthusiasm I have for computer science (I can't live without one of the two).
