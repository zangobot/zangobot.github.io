My name is [Luca Demetrio](https://csec.it/people/luca_demetrio), PhD student at [DIBRIS - University of Genova](https://www.dibris.unige.it/).
I'm also an amateur [Tap Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance) &  [Hip Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop) dancer.

This twin path started a long time ago: surprisingly my passion towards computer science and dancing grew up together. 
Logic and creativity, both sides of the same medal.

This is why my mind strangely perceives the world.

I have a lot of projects I want to work in, a lot of music to dance on and so much more: if you're going to follow my steps in those distant worlds... well, let's begin ;-)
