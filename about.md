My name is Luca Demetrio, I'm a PostDoc at [Pra Lab](https://pralab.diee.unica.it/), [Università degli Studi di Cagliari](https://www.unica.it).
There many things that captures my interests, from science to art.

One of these amazing stuffs is *adversarial machine learning*, or as I prefer, *the noble art of abusing AI programs*.
I'm currently studying evasion attacks against malware detectors, and I'm having so much fun :3

In my second life, I'm an *amateur dancer*, and my love for dancing is comparable to the enthusiasm I have for computer science (I can't live without one of the two).
